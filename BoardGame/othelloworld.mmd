%% Rules:

%% 2 players (Black & White), on 8x8 board.

%% Initial board: 4 pieces at the center.

%% Black moves first.

%% Black (White) place a black (white) piece on the board, 
%% in such a way that there is at least one straight 
%% (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) occupied line 
%% between the new piece and another black (white) piece, 
%% with one or more contiguous white (black) pieces between them.

%% After placing the piece, 
%% Black (White) flips all white pieces lying on a straight line
%% between the new piece and any existing black (white) pieces.

%% All flipped pieces are now black (white).

%% Players alternate taking turns.

%% If a player does not have any valid moves,
%% play passes back to the other player.

%% When neither player can move, the game ends.

%% A game of Othello may end before the board is completely filled.

%% The player with the most pieces on the board at the end of the game wins.

%% If both players have the same number of pieces, then the game is a draw.
